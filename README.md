# Mission-To-Mars

## Scraped data from 4 different websites.

-News Titles.   
-Image of Mars.    
-Table of Mars facts.     
-Images of Mars' hemispheres.     

## Linked all of this together

-index.html.    
-scrape_mars.py.    
-app.py.    


Run website via app.py, this will initiate index.html.  Once the website us running the 'Scrape Button' can be pressed to collect new data.  So it will initiate scrape_mars.py.   

I did build the scrape code via Mars.ipynb so that I could build the code while observing what was happening, then I converted it to a python code. This also helped as I was able to see what is being loaded into my database via Mongo Compass.   This allowed app.py and index.html to work with the files and create an updating website.
